                            Hello my name is Banks Piccinini and I am the tutor in Banks Tutoring! I grew up in the Marin County, California and living in this area I enjoyed time outdoors with my doodle dog, as well as cycling and hiking with my wife Oda.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            I attended Ross School and then went to Redwood High School always having a passion for math. I enjoyed reading the baseball stats page during the Barry Bonds era in San Francisco and loved seeing numbers.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            In High School I played baseball as a left fielder and pitcher with my team winning the league Senior year and getting recruited to play at College of Marin the next year. During high school I also spent time with friends riding my BMX bike at skateparks all around the Bay Area.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis in Computer Science from San Francisco State University. Since then I have been tutoring all levels of math building relationships with students/families helping them achieve their academic goals.
                            In early 2020 my tutoring business was driving to all of my clients houses and teaching them math. I would drive in my Prius all day with 15 minutes between meetings and loved it. Once the pandemic hit I had to change my business to Zoom and that is where I am today! 
                            I don't use a camera, so I don't expect you do either, and I write on my iPad the solutions to math problems explaining the process step-by-step. Everyone is different and I try to teach according to what resonates with the student the most. In my sessions it is okay to make 1000 mistakes, I am here to help and I encourage you to make mistakes! With sessions once weekly I have an incredible track record at helping students and changing their lives.
                            If you or anyone you know is looking for a math tutor/ private math teacher please let me know; phone or text or email works. Thank you!
                        </p>
