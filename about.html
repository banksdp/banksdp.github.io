                            Hello my name is Banks Piccinini and I am the tutor in Banks Tutoring! I grew up in the Marin County, California and living in this area I enjoyed time outdoors with my doodle dog, as well as cycling and hiking with my wife Oda.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I attended Ross School and Redwood High School always having a passion for math. I enjoyed reading the baseball stats page of the newspaper during the Barry Bonds era in San Francisco and loved seeing trends in the numbers.
                            In High School, I played baseball as a left fielder and pitcher and during my senior year we won the league. 
                            As a teenager not everything was math and baseball though, I also spent time with friends riding my BMX bike at skateparks all around the Bay Area.
                            After High School, I got recruited to play at College of Marin the next year but I decided to go out to college in Santa Barbara. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis in Computer Science from San Francisco State University. Since then I have been tutoring all levels of math building relationships with students/families while helping them achieve their academic goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In early 2020 my tutoring business involved me driving to all of my clients houses to teach them math. I would drive in my Prius all day with 15 minutes between meetings and loved it. Once the pandemic hit I had to change my business to Zoom and that is where I am today! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my Zoom sessions I don't use a camera, so I don't expect my clients use it either. I write math problems on my iPad while explaining the process to solving them step-by-step. Everyone is different, so I try to teach according to what resonates with the student the most. 
                            It is okay to make 1000 mistakes during my sessions, I am here to help and encourage my students to make mistakes so they can learn from them and succeed on their own! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With sessions once weekly I have an incredible track record at helping students and changing their lives.
                            If you or anyone you know is looking for a math tutor/ private math teacher please let me know; phone or text or email works. Thank you!
                        </p>
