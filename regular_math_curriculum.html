                <h4>Algebra</h4>
                <p>From solving equations to graphing functions, algebra is all about finding the right tools and techniques. I teach straightforward methods that work and help students feel comfortable and capable, no matter the problem.</p>
                <h4>Geometry</h4>
                <p>Shapes, angles, proofs—geometry doesn't have to feel like a puzzle. I'll break down concepts step by step, so students can see how it all fits together. They'll gain confidence and skills to tackle anything from transformations to coordinate geometry, all in a judgment-free, fun learning environment.</p>
                <h4>Pre-Calculus</h4>
                <p>Precalculus can feel like a leap, but it's all about preparation. Together, we'll build a solid foundation so students feel ready to handle calculus with ease. We'll focus on simplifying challenging topics like sequences, series, and functions, and making them fun along the way.</p>
                <h4>Calculus</h4>
                <p>Calculus doesn't have to be overwhelming. I'll guide students through derivatives, integrals, and limits with clear explanations, plenty of practice, and relatable examples that make abstract ideas feel real. Together, we'll make calculus a subject they can conquer.</p>
